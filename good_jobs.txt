🤖 AI ANALYSIS:
SCORE: 20%

The candidate, Adnan Saeed, has a strong background in AI and Machine Learning, with expertise in LangGraph, MCP, and RAG architectures. However, the job description is not available, making it difficult to assess the candidate's skills and experience against the specific job requirements.

Assuming the job requires a certain level of experience, the candidate's internship experience and lack of explicit mention of years of experience may be a significant mismatch. Given the critical scoring rules, if the job requires 3+ years of experience and the candidate has less than 1 year, the penalty would be -30 points. If the job requires 5+ years of experience and the candidate has less than 2 years, the penalty would be -50 points.

Additionally, without the job description, it's challenging to determine if the candidate has 70%+ of the required skills. While the candidate's technical skills, such as Python, SQL, and AI frameworks, are impressive, the lack of information about the job's specific requirements makes it difficult to assess the skills match.

Overall, given the uncertainty surrounding the job description and the potential experience level mismatch, a conservative score of 20% is assigned. This score reflects the candidate's potential, but also acknowledges the significant uncertainty and potential mismatches between the candidate's experience and the job requirements.

🤖 AI ANALYSIS:
SCORE: 10%

The candidate, Adnan Saeed, has a strong background in AI and Machine Learning, but his experience and skills do not match the requirements of the Purchasing Engineer job. The job requires a degree in Mechatronics Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Electronics Engineering, or Control & Automation Engineering, whereas Adnan's educational background is not specified, but his experience is in AI and Machine Learning.

The job requires 1-2 years of experience in industrial automation/industrial electronics, but Adnan's experience is in building scalable AI systems, developing autonomous web agents, and implementing intelligent contact-form detection. There is no mention of industrial automation or electronics in his experience.

Additionally, the job requires strong technical understanding of automation systems and industrial components, which is not evident in Adnan's profile. He has skills in languages like Python, SQL, and PostgreSQL, and AI frameworks like LangChain and TensorFlow, but these are not directly relevant to the job requirements.

Given the significant mismatch in experience and skills, it is unlikely that the company would hire Adnan for this role. Therefore, a low score of 10% is assigned, indicating a poor match between the candidate's profile and the job requirements.
