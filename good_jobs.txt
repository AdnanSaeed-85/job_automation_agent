SCORE: 60%
AI: To determine the match score, I'll compare the skills and experience listed in the resume with the requirements and responsibilities of the Production Engineer (University Grad) role at Meta.

The resume highlights expertise in AI, Machine Learning, and software development, with a strong focus on LangGraph, MCP, and RAG architectures. The experience section showcases projects and internships that demonstrate skills in building scalable AI systems, autonomous web agents, and conversational AI.

The Production Engineer role at Meta requires expertise in software engineering, writing high-quality code, and solving complex problems in live production. While the resume doesn't explicitly mention experience with Meta's specific products or infrastructure, the technical skills listed (e.g., Python, SQL, PostgreSQL) are relevant to the role.

However, there are some gaps in the match:

1. The resume focuses more on AI and Machine Learning, whereas the Production Engineer role is broader and encompasses various aspects of software engineering and infrastructure development.
2. The resume doesn't explicitly mention experience with large-scale systems, networking, or MySQL deployments, which are crucial aspects of the Production Engineer role.

Considering these factors, I'd give a match score of:
